[HOW TO BUILD]

This need "zlog" to build. It can be installed via GitHub https://github.com/HardySimpson/zlog
Qt is also needed for UI

After installed, type these:

$.> cd build
$./build> cmake ..
$./build> make

The ./build/streamserver is a console server, type "q\n" or send Ctrl+C to terminate it.
The ./build/altstreamserver is a console server using our own sync primitives.
The ./build/streamclient is a UI client
The ./build/test_socket_server is a console test for server and client. Need to modify src to compile.
